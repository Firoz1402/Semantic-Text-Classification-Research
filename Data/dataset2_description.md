# Dataset 2: News Articles Classification

This is the second dataset in a collection of four datasets containing news articles with different labels. In this dataset, we have collected news articles and categorized them into the following labels:

- World News
- US News
- Left News
- Political News
- Government News
- General News

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset has undergone extensive data preprocessing to ensure its quality and usability. The preprocessing steps include:

1. **Data Cleaning**: We performed data cleaning to remove any inconsistencies, such as missing values or duplicate articles. This step is essential for maintaining data integrity.

2. **Label Encoding**: We've encoded the labels into numerical values to facilitate machine learning and data analysis tasks. Each label corresponds to a unique numerical code.

3. **HTML Tag Removal**: To extract the textual content of the articles, we removed HTML tags and other markup language elements, ensuring that the dataset contains only plain text.

4. **Size Reduction**: The original dataset's size has been reduced by approximately 4 percent through various techniques, such as deduplication and selective sampling. This reduction was necessary to optimize storage and processing while preserving the dataset's diversity.
