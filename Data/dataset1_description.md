# Dataset 1: Medical Research Papers on Cancer

Welcome to Dataset 1, the first dataset in a collection of four datasets containing medical research papers with a focus on cancer-related topics. This dataset consists of research papers, each labeled with one of the following categories:

- Colon Cancer
- Lung Cancer
- Thyroid Cancer

## Dataset Overview

- **Size**: 7,570 research papers
- **Size Reduction**: No reduction in size was performed on this dataset.

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset has undergone a series of data preprocessing steps to ensure data quality and usability. The preprocessing process is outlined below:

1. **CSV Encoding**: Initially, there was an issue with the encoding of the CSV file. It was fixed using the `chardet` library, and the correct encoding was identified as MacRoman. This step was crucial to resolve encoding-related problems and make the data accessible.

2. **Standard Data Cleaning**: We performed standard data cleaning procedures, including the removal of any inconsistencies such as missing values, duplicated papers, and irrelevant information. Data cleaning is essential for maintaining data integrity and ensuring the dataset's reliability.

## Repository Contents

In this repository, you will find the following files:

- `dataset1.csv`: The dataset containing the medical research papers with their associated labels.
- `Data-PreProcessing(Dataset 1).ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook detailing the data preprocessing steps, including the CSV encoding correction and standard data cleaning. This notebook can be found in the `../Data PreProcessing` directory.
- `dataset1_description.md`: A comprehensive document providing detailed information about the dataset's structure, column descriptions, and label mappings.

## Datasets Overview

This is the first dataset in a collection of four datasets, each focusing on different aspects of cancer-related research. Dataset 1, as described here, is dedicated to research papers related to colon cancer, lung cancer, and thyroid cancer.
