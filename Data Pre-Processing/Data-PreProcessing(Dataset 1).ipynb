excretion and redoxregulation other complex mechanisms are also likelyinvolved in the dxr resistance in cd44cd133 cells discussionby using the wellrecognized cell surface markers of cd44and cd133 for csc identiÔ¨Åcation we tried to separate thehct8 human colon cancer cells into cd44 cd44 cd44cd133 and cd44cd133 subpopulations and then investigated how the expressions of cd44 and cd133 associatedwith drug resistance actually we checked several cancer celllines on the expression of cd44 and cd133 including helacells and a549 cells however both hela cells and a549 cellsshowed almost  expression of cd44 only the hct8cells showed a partial expression of cd44 about  anda rare expression of cd133 therefore we only isolateddiÔøΩerent subpopulations from hct8 cells for this studyfirst we found that the expression level of cd44 keptvery stable in the cd44cd133 cells but gradually declinedin cd44cd133 cells during a cell passaging process on theother hand some of cd44 cells shifted to express cd44 during a cell passaging process figure 1c these Ô¨Åndings suggested the plasticity of cd44 expression in hct8 cellsactually ohata et al reported that cd44 highexpressedcells from human intractable colon cancer patients can diÔøΩerentiate into cd44 lowexpressed cells and a fraction of cd44lowexpressed cells can also generate cd44 highexpressedcells in a xenograft mouse model   however it is unclearwhy the cd44cd133 cells but not cd44cd133 cellsstably maintain the expression level of cd44 unlike theextensive expression of cd44 with high plasticity the expression of cd133 was only observed in very few of the hct8cells with poor plasticitya number of previous studies have demonstrated thatcscs are likely resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs thecd44cd133 cells but not the cd44 and cd44cd133cells showed dxr resistance figure 2a according to thisdata the expression of cd133 but not cd44 seems to beclosely associated with drug resistance actuallythesecd44cd133 cells showed the enhanced expression ofabcb1 and the decreased intracellular accumulation ofdxr figures 2b and 2c liu et al reported that nonsmallcell lung cancer cells treated with lowdose cddp aresuÔ¨Écient to enrich cd133 cells and upregulate abcb1expression through notch signaling which thereforeincreases the crossresistance to dxr   however theinhibition of abcb1 by verapamil only partially improvedthe dxr resistance of cd44cd133 cells in this studyto Ô¨Ånd other potential mechanisms involving in thedxr resistance of cd44cd133 cells we investigatedseveral interesting aspects including the stress protectionand redox regulation we found that p38mapk one of themost popular protein kinases known to be activated byinÔ¨Çammatory cytokines lipopolysaccharide osmotic shockultraviolet light and other stresses was more obviouslyinduced by dxr in cd44cd133 cells than cd44cd133cells figure  moreover the activation of p38 mapk wasnot dependent on the intracellular accumulation of dxrfigure dxr is known to insert between the base pairs of dna oftumor cells and exhibits antitumor eÔøΩects by suppressing thebiosynthesis of both dna and rna through the inhibitionof dna polymerase rna polymerase and topoisomeraseii reactions furthermore it is believed that dxr has theability to generate suÔ¨Écient ros to raise oxidative stressindeed we observed dxrinduced ros generation in bothcd44cd133 and cd44cd133 cells butthe dxrinduced ros generation was detected even higher in cd44cd133 than cd44cd133 cells independent on the intracellular accumulation of dxr figures 5a 2b and 3bsuggesting the enhanced antioxidant capacity in cd44cd133 cellsthe keap1nrf2 control system plays a central role in theantioxidant defense mechanisms nrf2 is known as a transcription factor to activate various genes involving in biological defense mechanisms it has been reported that nrf2 isconstantly expressed in many cancer cells [ÔøΩ] moreover the enhanced expression of nrf2 has been conÔ¨Årmedto associate with poor prognosis of cancer patients [ÔøΩ]in our study nrf2 expression was detected higher in cd44cd133 than cd44cd133 cells and the diÔøΩerence in nrf2expression was observed even clearer between cells with dxradministrationindependent on the dxr accumulationfigure 5b these Ô¨Åndings also clearly indicate theenhanced antioxidant capacity in cd44cd133 cellsalthough the absence of direct evidence by interferenceexperiment pathways involving in the stress protection andredox regulation might at least partially contributed to thedxr resistance of cd44cd133 cellsvery strangely our data showed that the silencing ofcd133 expression in cd44cd133 cells by sirna couldonly partially increase the cytotoxicity of dxr figure 6bbut did not change the expression of abcb1 and the intracellular accumulation of dxr figure 6c other unknownmechanisms beyond the drug excretion and redox regulationare asked to be deÔ¨Åned on the dxr resistance of cd44cd133 cellsbased on data from the present study the expression ofcd133 rather than cd44 more closely associated with theresistance of cancer cells to anticancer drug as complexmechanisms including the drug excretion and redox regulation are likely involved in the drug resistance of cscs multiple approaches may be needed to overcome the big problemof drug resistance in cancer
