## Dataset Overview

- **Original Size**: 50,425 product descriptions
- **Size After Reduction**: 27,000 product descriptions
- **Size Reduction**: The dataset has undergone a significant size reduction of approximately 46.5 percent to 27,000 product descriptions due to the removal of duplicates.

## Data Preprocessing
